Hunter Smalls is a 15-year-old with ADHD living in Lincoln, Nebraska. 
He likes videogames, dinosaurs, and trivia questions. He is an extremely 
condescending child and because of this, he has no friends. Now he spends 
all of his time online. He had an easy time at school when he was younger, 
but now that more work is expected, he has struggled to keep up. His parents
reacted strongly to his scholastic struggles, and finally decided that 
spending 10+ hours a day playing Destiny 2 and going on reddit was not the 
best use of his time. They set up a program on the computer that only lets 
Hunter access "educational websites" after 5pm. He still wants to learn things 
and have fun doing it, but social media are blocked. He found our website and 
enjoys the variety of games, both educational and not. He especially loves that 
he can boast to his parents about something he learned on the Jeopardy game.
