<- Hunter Smalls -> 
Hunter Smalls is a 15-year-old with ADHD living in Lincoln, Nebraska. He likes videogames, dinosaurs, and trivia questions. He is an extremely condescending child and because of this, he has no friends. Now he spends all of his time online. He had an easy time at school when he was younger, but now that more work is expected, he has struggled to keep up. His parents reacted strongly to his scholastic struggles, and finally decided that spending 10+ 
hours a day playing Destiny 2 and going on reddit was not the best use of his time. They set up a program on the computer that only lets Hunter access "educational websites" after 5pm. He still wants to learn things and have fun doing it, but social media are blocked. He found our website and enjoys the variety of games, both educational and not. He especially loves that he can boast to his parents about something he learned on the Jeopardy game.
